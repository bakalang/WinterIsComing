/**
 * A class used to represent rows in the BOOKS table <br>
 * Note: class member naming tip: data type and name must match SQL table!<br>
 * Note: DBUtils uses reflection to match column names to class member names. <br>
 * Class members are matched to columns based on several factors:
 * <ul>
 * <li>set* methods that match the table's column names (i.e. title <--> setTitle()). The name comparison is case insensitive.</li>
 * <li>The columns are matched to the object's class members</li>
 * <li>If the conversion fails (i.e. the property was an int and the column was a Timestamp) an SQLException is thrown.</li>
